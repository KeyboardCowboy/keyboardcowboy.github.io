As the first part of my effort to get myself back on a productive track, my goal is to write at least one blog post or journal entry a week.  Where this has failed in the past, I really need to make it succeed now.  This is a very simple thing to do.  I can do it from anywhere.  I just need to maintain the drive to do it and not procrastinate.  The journal entries are just the next step, however.

I've been on this roller coaster for a long time.  I'll be very productive and driven.  I'll eat well, drink less, work harder, get more done, spend less time watching TV, only to fall back into my old habits again.  Time and again I rotate through this cycle.  Now that I've identified the pattern, it's time to break it.

This time I am approaching my climb out of the doldrums a little differently.  Rather than charge at success head first to see how far I can get before I fall over, I'm starting slow.  I'm going to take one step at a time and really work at it until it becomes a part of my regular routine, then take another step.  This way I continue to build a stable platform to support each successive step.

After writing this out, it makes even more sense.  Think about the tortoise and the hare.  When you try to do everything at once, you burn yourself out.  When you get to the end you're left with nothing.  Make your moves patiently and deliberately.  To make a more relative comparison, this is also a lot like climbing a 14er.  It may start out easy, but as you go farther each step gets harder and takes more effort.  Trying to run up the mountain is the most ignorant thing you can do.  It takes planning, preparation, and above all, patience.

After a few more of these entries, time to move on to the next step.  Just so I don't forget, here are some of the next things I am tackling: drinking less, eating better, exercising regularly, watching less TV, getting more done on the house, constructively relaxing...the list goes on.  It's all about setting goals, moving forward and assimilating.
