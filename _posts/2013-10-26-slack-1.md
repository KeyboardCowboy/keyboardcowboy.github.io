The wedding was 3 months ago today. It's hard to believe that it's been that long.  Though we are not swamped planning this thing anymore, there are still so many things happening I still feel stretched to my limits.  I was excited to be done with the wedding so I could get some time back to focus on other important things like work and the house, but so far that hasn't happened.

Weekends have been filled with friends visiting from out of town, concerts, football and various other things. Weekdays have been filled with work at NREL then freelance jobs afterward.  I feel like I've preached this sermon before.  This year we didn't do any hiking or camping, didn't climb any 14ers, I still haven't replaced my bike, I haven't gotten any work done on the house and I've barely gotten my business anywhere.  I came up with lots of reasons why, blaming the wedding, the honeymoon, the freelance work and just needing a break. The truth of the matter is, I probably could have gotten a lot more done if I really wanted to. Those aren't really reasons. They are excuses.  Excuses to have fun instead of work.

I haven't been happy with a lot of the decisions I've been making lately. I've been drinking too much beer.  I've been allowing myself to get caught up in meaningless things like fantasy football and TV shows. I've ignored my todo list knowing I can easily roll things over to next week, then the next week...  I've justified it all by saying that I need the time to unwind. To decompress. And that's not totally untrue. However, it has gotten a little out of control. It all came together for me this weekend.

I set up a meeting with Mario to watch the Broncos game and talk a little business. I had a couple of beers and some greasy, delicious bar food, we watched the game and we talked a little business. Mario arrived late becuase he was coming from the gym and left to go play basketball with some friends.  He is always moving at a cheetah's pace. When he said he was in the best shape of his life and he's got his business rolling, and he still had time to catch the game, it hit me. Those are all things I want, and I'm doing everything to prevent it from happening for me.  I need to start changing some things about my lifestyle and the decisions I've been making.

Then, after we got home we stopped over at the neighbors house to see their new floors. The new hardwood floors looked amazing. I was jealous. They also told us about various other projects they were working on and what they had planned.   Those are all things I want to do to my house. I keep putting them off and putting them off again.  Something needs to change.

And that leads me into my biggest problem. I want to do too many things. I really don't feel like this is an excuse, but more of a problem. I want to become better at the guitar and start some freelance web projects to make money and donate web time for charities and schools and fix up the house and go on vacation and get in shape and run races.

So there it is. Step 1. I've identified the problem. Step 2?  Start working on a solution.
