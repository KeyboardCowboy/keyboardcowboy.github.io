Hi.  My name is Chris and I write code.  Lots of code.  I also like to play the
guitar and explore the fantastic state of Colorado, in which I currently reside.
And no, this is not just a blog.  It's also my playground and my little slice
of the web to do with what I please.  I may share some ideas about what I am
working on, tell you about my last vacation or tell you all the cool apps I can't
live without.  Depends on how I'm feeling that particular day.

Ok, I know there's not much here yet.  I'm working on it.  There will be more
fun stuff to come, I promise.  For now, go check out the other pages.
